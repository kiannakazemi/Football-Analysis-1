Football Analysis and Visualisation with Python

Consider the match data of the football world championships from 1872 to 2020 available for free on the Kaggle website:

First, I upload the csv file data into the pandas dataframe, and choosed my favorite team which I called it S. Then I resolved the following queries regarding S:

      - Calculate the number of wins, losses and draws
      
      - Calculate the average of the goals scored and conceded
      
      - Graph the progress of the games played by S in terms of goals scored and conceded
      
      - Select the teams with better results than S
      
      - Calculate the maximum number of consecutive wins of S
